This problem asks us to show that there are no acceptable solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the infinite square well when the energy $E$ is zero or negative.

### Case 1: E = 0

The time-independent Schrödinger equation is:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi = E\psi
$$

Inside the well, $V(x) = 0$, and with $E = 0$, the equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = 0
$$

The general solution to this is a linear function:

$$
\psi(x) = Ax + B
$$

Now we must apply the boundary conditions for the infinite square well, which are $\psi(0) = 0$ and $\psi(L) = 0$.

1.  Applying the first condition, $\psi(0) = 0$:
    $A(0) + B = 0 \implies B = 0$.

2.  With $B=0$, our solution is $\psi(x) = Ax$. Applying the second condition, $\psi(L) = 0$:
    $A(L) = 0 \implies A = 0$.

Since both $A$ and $B$ must be zero, the only solution is $\psi(x) = 0$. This is the trivial solution and is not physically acceptable (it means there is no particle), so there are no solutions for $E=0$.

### Case 2: E < 0

For $E < 0$, the Schrödinger equation inside the well is:

$$
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi
$$

Since $E$ is negative, the term $\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}$ is also negative. Let's define a positive constant $\kappa^2 = -\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}$. The equation becomes:

$$
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = -\kappa^2\psi
$$

Oops, wait. That's not right. The right side is positive. Let's define the positive constant $\kappa^2 = \frac{2m|E|}{\hbar^2}$. The equation is actually:

$$
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = \kappa^2\psi
$$

The general solution to this equation involves real exponentials, not sines and cosines...
